#                        WELCOME!
#
# This file allows users to configure the sensor tasks to be run
# automatically on pre-determined time-shedules
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# Each task needs to follow the syntax:
#
#  M H DOM MON DOW  COMMAND
#
#  -'M H DOM MON DOW' fields speficies the time-schedule of the task.
#    The time can be defined with concrete values for  minute(M),
#    hour(H), day of month(DOM), month(MON), and day of the week(DOW),
#    or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
#
#  -'COMMAND' specifies the command/script to be executed
#
#
#  For example, you can run a 'sudo reboot' command
#  at 6 AM every day by introducing the following:
#  0 6 * * * sudo reboot
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# Also see 'https://crontab.guru' for knowing how to schedule tasks.
#
# Insert your tasks to run automatically above:
